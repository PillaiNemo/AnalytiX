This project is a simple and practical platform for automated data analysis. The goal is to help users quickly understand their dataset without spending hours on manual exploratory analysis.

The system allows users to upload a dataset and automatically generates useful statistics, visualizations, and insights. It is designed to make data analysis faster and easier, especially for beginners, students, and non-technical users.

📌 Why I built this

In many real-world situations, a lot of time is spent just trying to understand the data before building any machine learning model. This includes checking missing values, distributions, correlations, and possible issues.

I built this project to automate that process and make it more efficient. Instead of doing everything manually, the system provides a structured and guided workflow.
