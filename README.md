Data Insights Hub

**Introduction**

Data Insights Hub is a web application that automates basic exploratory data analysis. It allows users to upload a dataset and quickly understand its structure, data quality, and relationships through statistics and visualizations.

**Problem**

Exploratory data analysis is a repetitive and time-consuming step in most data workflows. Beginners often find it difficult to check missing values, distributions, and correlations manually. This project aims to simplify and automate these steps.

**Objectives**

The main goals of this project are to automate data profiling, provide clear visualizations, and improve data understanding before model building. The system is designed to be simple and easy to use.

**System Overview**

The user uploads a dataset, and the system automatically performs analysis and generates visual insights. The results are displayed in an interactive dashboard.

**Workflow**

Upload dataset → Data processing → Statistical analysis → Visualization → Dashboard.

**Technology**

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit are used to build the system.

**Challenges**

Handling different dataset structures, managing missing values, and designing a simple user interface were key challenges.

**Future Work**

Future improvements include anomaly detection, automated model recommendation, report generation, and support for larger datasets.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how automation can reduce manual effort in exploratory data analysis and improve efficiency.
